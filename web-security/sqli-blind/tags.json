    "summary": "This challenge involves exploiting a blind SQL injection vulnerability in a Flask web application using SQLite, where an attacker can extract the flag bit-by-bit by interpreting binary responses from crafted boolean queries. It requires bypassing authentication by leveraging the conditional behavior of the database query without direct data feedback."
