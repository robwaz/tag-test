- stored XSS
- HTML injection
prerequisites:
- HTML
- HTTP
summary: This challenge exploits a stored XSS vulnerability in a forum-like web application
  where unsanitized user input is injected into the HTML. The goal is to inject a
  valid textbox so that a simulated victim encounters three <input> elements, thereby
  releasing the flag.
