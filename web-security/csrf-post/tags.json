    "summary": "This challenge requires crafting an HTML form that auto-submits a POST request to bypass the browser\u2019s Same-Origin Policy, thereby exploiting a CSRF vulnerability. By tricking the victim\u2019s admin session to submit the form, the attacker forces an action that exposes the flag."
