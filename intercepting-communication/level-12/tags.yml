summary: "This challenge requires manually crafting and sending a custom ARP is-at\
  \ packet to bind IP 10.0.0.42 to MAC 42:42:42:42:42:42, which triggers the flag\
  \ disclosure on the remote host. It tests the participant\u2019s understanding of\
  \ ARP protocol mechanics and raw packet injection techniques."
