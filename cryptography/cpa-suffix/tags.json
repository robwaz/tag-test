    "summary": "This challenge involves exploiting ECB\u2019s deterministic block encryption by constructing a codebook from chosen plaintexts to iteratively recover the secret flag\u2019s tail. It is a twist on the classic byte-at-a-time decryption attack where only the flag's tail end is accessible for encryption queries."
