    "summary": "This challenge presents an AES-ECB encryption oracle that concatenates attacker-supplied posts with a secret flag (stored in a SQLite database) and returns the ciphertext in base64. Solvers must craft chosen plaintexts to exploit ECB\u2019s deterministic block structure and recover the hidden flag."
