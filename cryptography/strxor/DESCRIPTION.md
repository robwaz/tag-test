Okay, now you know how to XOR ASCII characters.
This is a critical step as we build up to our first cryptosystem, but now, we need to XOR entire ASCII strings!
Let's try this.

Like Python provides the `^` operator to XOR integers, a Python library called PyCryptoDome provides a function called `strxor` to XOR two strings of characters together.
You can import it in Python using `from Crypto.Util.strxor import strxor`.

XORing two strings is done byte by byte, just like XORing two bytes is done bit by bit.
So, to draw on an earlier example:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ python
>>> from Crypto.Util.strxor import strxor
>>> strxor(b"AAA", b"16/")
b'pwn'
```

You can verify this yourself with the ASCII table: A ^ 1 is p, A ^ 6 is w, and A ^ / is n.
We just decrypted the _ciphertext_ `AAA` with the _key_ `16/` to retrieve the _plaintext_ `pwn`.

In this challenge, you'll do this several times in a row: like the previous challenge, but with strings!
Good luck!

**CAVEAT:**
What are these `b`s prepended to the quotes?
Python's default string representation (e.g., `"AAA"`) is [_Unicode_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), and unlike, say, the Latin alphabet, Unicode encompasses all characters known to humanity (including the Latin alphabet)!
This means a single character can have thousands of different values (when this text was written, Unicode encompassed 154,998 characters!), from "A" to "ðŸ’©".

Unfortunately, a single byte of 8 bits can only hold `2**8 == 256` different values, which is enough for ASCII (not that many letters/numbers/etc in the Latin alphabet), but not enough for Unicode.
Unicode is _encoded_ using different encodings, such as the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) we mentioned earlier.
UTF-8 is designed to be backwards-compatible with ASCII "A" is just 0x41, something like "ðŸ’©" is _four_ bytes: `f0 9f 92 a9`!

Basically, `ASCII` is to `The Latin Alphabet` as `UTF-8` is to `Unicode`, and in the same way that the Latin alphabet is a subset of Unicode, ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.
Wild.

Anyways, Python's normal strings (and, typically, `input()` you get from the terminal) are Unicode, but some functions, such as `strxor`, consume and produce _bytes_.
You can specify them directly, as I did above, by prepending your quotes with `b` (for **b**ytes) and using ASCII or hex encoding (e.g., `b"AAA"` and `b"A\x41\x41"` are equivalent), or you can _encode_ a Unicode string into bytes using UTF-8, as such: `"AAA".encode() == b"AAA"` or `"ðŸ’©".encode() == b"\xf0\x9f\x92\xa9"`.
You can also _decode_ the resulting bytes back into Unicode strings: `b"AAA".decode() == "AAA"` or `b"\xf0\x9f\x92\xa9".decode() == "ðŸ’©"`.

This is _further_ complicated by the fact that UTF-8 can't turn any arbitrary bytes into Unicode.
For example, `b'\xb0'.decode()` raises an exception.
You can fix this by abandoning the default UTF-8 and using a pre-Unicode non-encoding encoding like "[latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1)"/ISO-8859-1, from the ancient days of computing, as so: `b'\xb0'.decode('latin')`.
While ISO-8859-1 originally predated Unicode, its Python implementation converts to Unicode strings.
However, keep in mind that this encoding is _different_ from UTF-8: `b"\xb0".encode('latin").decode() == b'\xc2\xb0'`.
You must, instead, be consistent and decode and encode with the same encoding: `b"\xb0".encode('latin").decode(latin1) == b"\xb0"`.

Anyways, all this sounds terrifying, but it's mostly a warning for the future.
For _this_ level, we VERY carefully chose the characters so that you don't run into these issues.

**CAUTION:**
Python's strings-vs-bytes situation is terrible and _will_ byte (haha!) you eventually.
There's no way to avoid pitfalls --- they still get us after years and years of using Python, so you will just have to learn to pick yourself up, brush yourself off, fix your code, and carry on.
With enough experience under your belt, you will improve from losing _entire freaking days_ to bugs caused by string/bytes mixups to merely _entire freaking hours_.
