    "summary": "This challenge exploits a padding oracle vulnerability in AES-CBC encryption when a full block of plaintext leads to an extra block of predictable PKCS7 padding. By tampering with the ciphertext (specifically the block preceding the padding block), attackers can recover and manipulate the penultimate block to eventually forge the password and redeem the flag."
