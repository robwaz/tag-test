summary: This challenge exploits an SQL injection vulnerability in a Flask app that
  uses SQLite to store a flag and returns its result encrypted with AES in ECB mode.
  By crafting a custom SQL query (e.g., using SELECT 'chosen_text'), the attacker
  can manipulate the output to recover the flag.
