summary: This challenge asks players to modify an AES-CBC ciphertext to change the
  decrypted command, exploiting the malleability of CBC mode and carefully handling
  PKCS#7 padding. The twist is that changing command lengths requires an understanding
  of how padding is applied and can affect the overall structure of the plaintext.
