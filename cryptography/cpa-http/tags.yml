summary: "This challenge mixes data encoding with cryptographic and database vulnerabilities\
  \ by outputting AES-encrypted, base64\u2010encoded results from an unsanitized SQL\
  \ query. Solvers must exploit SQL injection and handle base64 encoding to extract\
  \ the secret flag stored in a temporary SQLite database."
