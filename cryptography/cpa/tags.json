    "summary": "The challenge leverages the vulnerabilities inherent in AES\u2019s ECB mode by allowing the attacker to perform a chosen plaintext attack and build a ciphertext-to-plaintext codebook. This mapping is then used to decrypt the flag, with automation via pwntools recommended to facilitate interactions."
