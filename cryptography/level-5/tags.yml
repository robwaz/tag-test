summary: This challenge is a variant of the ECB byte-at-a-time decryption where you
  must craft a prefix to precisely control block alignment in order to build a ciphertext
  codebook. By exploiting the deterministic nature of AES in ECB mode with PKCS#7
  padding, the attacker can recover the unknown flag appended to the input.
