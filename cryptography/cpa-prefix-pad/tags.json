    "summary": "This challenge presents an AES ECB encryption oracle that correctly implements PKCS7 padding, including adding a full-padding (decoy) block when the plaintext length is a multiple of 16. Participants must craft chosen plaintexts to bypass this padding quirk and recover the secret flag appended to their input."
