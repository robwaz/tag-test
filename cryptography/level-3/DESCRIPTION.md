The previous challenge gave you the one time pad to decrypt the ciphertext.
If you did not know the one time pad, and it was only ever used for one message, the previous challenge would be unsolvable!
In this level, we'll explore what happens if the latter condition is violated.
You don't get the key this time, but we'll let you encrypt as many messages as you want.
Can you decrypt the flag?

**Hint:** think deeply about how XOR works, and consider that it is a distributative, commutative, and associative operation...

**Hint:** we recommend writing your solution in Python and using the `strxor` function that we use in the challenge! It makes life much simpler.
