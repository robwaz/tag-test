summary: This challenge requires exploiting UNIX file and directory permission mechanics
  in a multi-user environment by switching between accounts to access a flag placed
  in a temporary directory with specific ownership and mode settings. Solvers must
  understand and maneuver through permission and group ownership nuances to retrieve
  the flag.
