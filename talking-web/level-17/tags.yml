summary: This challenge requires participants to use netcat (nc) to craft a raw HTTP
  GET request that includes multiple query parameters. In the 'arg_multi' variant,
  the request must supply parameters 'a' and 'b' with exact values, including characters
  that must be properly encoded, while the server additionally checks that the correct
  client binary (nc) is being used.
