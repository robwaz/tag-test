summary: This challenge requires crafting a manually crafted HTTP request with a URL
  path that includes spaces which must be correctly URL-encoded. The request must
  be sent using the netcat (nc) command to a Flask server that validates the path
  against an expected format. Success in encoding and submitting the proper path returns
  the flag.
