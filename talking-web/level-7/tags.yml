summary: "This challenge requires participants to send an HTTP request with a precisely\
  \ crafted path. The server generates a random path value and validates that the\
  \ request\u2019s path, sent using the curl command, exactly matches this value.\
  \ Additionally, the server checks that the request is made from the expected client\
  \ environment, ensuring proper execution context before releasing the flag."
