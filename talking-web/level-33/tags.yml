summary: This challenge requires you to make an HTTP request using Python that correctly
  handles a redirect. On your first request the server responds with a redirect to
  a randomly generated URL; following this redirect yields the flag. It is an intentionally
  easy level meant to familiarize you with redirect handling using python-requests.
