summary: "This challenge requires you to use netcat (nc) to interact with a web server\
  \ that issues an HTTP redirect. You must manually follow the redirect \u2014 crafting\
  \ raw HTTP requests without automated tools \u2014 to finally retrieve the flag.\
  \ The server also enforces client validation to ensure that the connection is made\
  \ using nc."
