summary: This challenge requires crafting an HTTP POST request using curl that includes
  form data. The server expects a specific form parameter 'a' with a random value
  and enforces that the request originates from the curl client by validating the
  client process's properties. Correctly formatting the request and using curl will
  reveal the flag.
