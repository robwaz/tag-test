    "summary": "This challenge requires making a series of stateful HTTP requests to a Flask server. Using the nc command, the participant must manage session cookies and correctly follow redirects, as the server tracks state over four requests before revealing the flag. Additionally, the server validates the client\u2019s identity, enforcing the use of the correct tool."
