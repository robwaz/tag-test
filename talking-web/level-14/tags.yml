summary: This challenge requires you to use the netcat command to craft an HTTP GET
  request that meets strict validation rules. The server, built with Flask, expects
  a specific query parameter 'a' with a predetermined value derived from a seeded
  random process, and it checks that the client process is indeed nc. Knowledge of
  HTTP request structure and command-line networking is essential to retrieve the
  flag.
