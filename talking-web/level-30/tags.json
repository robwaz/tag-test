    "summary": "This challenge requires participants to craft an HTTP POST request with a complex, nested JSON payload. The payload must include specific key-value pairs and list elements as dictated by the server, and the Content-Type header must be set to 'application/json'. The request must be made using a Python client, and the Flask server validates both the structure and values to return the flag."
