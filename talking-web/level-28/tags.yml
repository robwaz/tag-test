summary: The challenge requires sending an HTTP POST request using curl with a complex
  JSON body. The JSON payload must include a top-level key 'a' and a nested object
  under key 'b' with specific values, including a list, that exactly match dynamically
  generated values. Additionally, the server validates that the request is made using
  the curl client.
