    "summary": "This challenge requires you to follow an HTTP redirect to obtain the flag. The server sends a redirect response when a request is made to a non-matching URL, so using curl\u2019s redirection-following option (e.g., -L) allows you to automatically follow the redirect and retrieve the flag."
