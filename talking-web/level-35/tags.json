    "summary": "This challenge requires interacting with a Flask web server that uses a cookie-based mechanism to reveal a flag. The server first sets a cookie and then expects the client to include it in a follow-up request. Additionally, participants must use the nc command to craft the HTTP request, testing their knowledge of HTTP protocol and manual request crafting."
