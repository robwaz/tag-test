summary: This challenge requires contestants to send an HTTP POST request from a Python
  client that includes a JSON payload. The Flask server checks that the Content-Type
  is set to application/json and that the JSON body contains a specific key-value
  pair matching a predetermined value. Additionally, the server validates that the
  request originates from a Python process with proper system privileges.
