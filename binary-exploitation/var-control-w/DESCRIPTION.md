So far, your buffer overflows have simply set variables to non-zero values.
Of course, memory errors often enable significantly more advanced controls over a program's state.
In this challenge, you must overflow the buffer precisely to set a win condition variable to a specific value.
Some things to keep in mind:

- You will need to write binary data.
  This can't be printed on the keyboard; we recommend that you use something like Python to produce these bytes.
- Keep endianness in mind!
- Depending on how you generate the input data, you might accidentally terminate it with a newline!
  For example, bash's `echo` will newline-terminate by default (this behavior can be disabled using the `-n` flag).
  These newlines can cause problems --- if you are relying on precise control of program variables (which you are, in this module), an errant newline can unexpectedly corrupt program state and break your exploit.
  If you have doubts about whether your input has an errant newline, save it to a file and look at it using a hex dumper such as `hd`.
