summary1: This challenge involves a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited
  by providing a crafted ciphertext. The program decrypts the ciphertext using AES-ECB
  and the result is written to the stack, causing a buffer overflow. The goal is to
  overwrite the return address with the address of shellcode that is also injected
  onto the stack. The challenge provides the necessary information to calculate the
  buffer overflow offset and the address of the shellcode.
