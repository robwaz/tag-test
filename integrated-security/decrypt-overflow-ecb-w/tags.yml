summary1: This challenge involves a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited
  by providing a crafted ciphertext. The program decrypts the ciphertext using AES-ECB
  and the result is written to the stack, causing a buffer overflow. The goal is to
  overwrite the return address with the address of a `win` function. The challenge
  provides the necessary information to calculate the buffer overflow offset and the
  address of the `win` function.
