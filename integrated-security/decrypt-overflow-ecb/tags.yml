summary: Exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability by crafting a ciphertext that, when
  decrypted via AES-ECB, overwrites the stack's return address with the address of
  a win function.
summary1: This challenge combines cryptography and binary exploitation. The goal is
  to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability by crafting a ciphertext that, when decrypted
  by the program using AES-ECB, overwrites the return address on the stack with the
  address of a `win` function. This requires manually identifying the buffer overflow
  offset and the address of the `win` function using reverse engineering.
