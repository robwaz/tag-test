summary1: The web server is vulnerable to a classic path traversal attack. By crafting
  a GET request with `GET ../../../../../../../../flag HTTP/1.0`, an attacker can
  navigate up the directory tree from the web root and access the `/flag` file, which
  is outside of the intended document directory. The server's lack of input sanitization
  on the requested path allows for this unauthorized file access.
