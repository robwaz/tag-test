summary: The server is vulnerable to path traversal. By crafting a GET request with
  `../` in the path, it's possible to access and read the contents of `/flag`.
summary1: The web server is vulnerable to a classic path traversal attack. By crafting
  a GET request with `GET ../../../../../../../../flag HTTP/1.0`, an attacker can
  navigate up the directory tree from the web root and access the `/flag` file, which
  is outside of the intended document directory. The server's lack of input sanitization
  on the requested path allows for this unauthorized file access.
