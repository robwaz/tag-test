summary: Inject and execute shellcode by exploiting a buffer overflow, using a crafted
  AES-ECB ciphertext to overwrite the return address with the shellcode's address
  on the stack, requiring manual discovery of the overflow offset
summary1: This challenge combines cryptography and binary exploitation. The goal is
  to inject and execute shellcode by exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability. The
  exploit involves crafting a ciphertext that, when decrypted by the program using
  AES-ECB, overwrites the return address on the stack with the address of the injected
  shellcode. This requires manually identifying the buffer overflow offset and the
  address of the shellcode on the stack.
