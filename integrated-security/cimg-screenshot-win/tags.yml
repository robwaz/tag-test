summary1: This challenge involves crafting a malicious CIMG image file to exploit
  a buffer overflow vulnerability. The goal is to overwrite the return address on
  the stack to redirect execution to a hidden `win` function. When called, this function
  takes a screenshot of the application's framebuffer, which contains the flag, and
  writes it to a file.
