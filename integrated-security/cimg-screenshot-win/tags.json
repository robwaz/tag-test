    "summary1": "This challenge involves crafting a malicious CIMG image file to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. The goal is to overwrite the return address on the stack to redirect execution to a hidden `win` function. When called, this function takes a screenshot of the application's framebuffer, which contains the flag, and writes it to a file."
