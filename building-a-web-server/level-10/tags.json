    "summary": "This challenge requires participants to implement a web server in assembly that handles HTTP POST requests by reading and updating file content. The provided harness sets up a multi-process, sandboxed environment using Linux namespaces and validates execution via strace to ensure correct syscall behavior. Solvers must manage concurrent connections and adhere to strict syscall patterns to succeed."
