summary: This challenge requires writing a minimal web server in assembly that statically
  responds to HTTP requests. The implementation must correctly perform socket operations
  (bind, listen, accept, read, write) and handle GET/POST interactions with file I/O.
  It runs in a sandboxed environment using Linux namespaces and its system call behavior
  is validated against expected strace output.
