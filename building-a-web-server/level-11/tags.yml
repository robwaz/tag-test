summary: This challenge requires building a multi-process web server that handles
  concurrent HTTP GET and POST requests. The solution must adhere to a strict syscall
  sequence as verified by strace and run inside a Linux namespace-based sandbox. Participants
  are expected to implement low-level code (typically in assembly) that manages process
  control and network I/O correctly.
