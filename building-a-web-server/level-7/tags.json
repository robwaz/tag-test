    "summary": "This challenge requires building a minimal web server that correctly handles HTTP GET requests to serve file contents. The solution must perform a precise sequence of system calls (socket, bind, listen, accept, read, open, write) that are validated via strace output. Additionally, the server is run inside a secure sandbox using Linux namespaces with injected signals, making careful use of low-level operations and system call behavior."
