summary: This challenge tasks participants with writing an assembly program that creates
  a TCP socket. The solution is run in a sandboxed environment that leverages Linux
  namespaces and strace to verify the proper system call sequence (socket, bind, listen,
  accept, etc.). It is an early stage in a series aimed at gradually building a full
  web server.
