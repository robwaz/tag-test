    "summary": "This challenge requires building a minimal web server that accepts an incoming connection. The solution must implement key networking syscalls (socket, bind, listen, and accept) with specific criteria (binding to 0.0.0.0 on port 80) and operate within a sandboxed environment using Linux namespaces. Strace is used to validate the correct syscall sequence."
