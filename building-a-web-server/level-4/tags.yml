summary: This challenge requires participants to write an assembly program that implements
  a minimal web server. The program must create a socket, bind, and listen, while
  its behavior is validated via strace logs in a sandboxed Linux namespace environment.
  The expected system call pattern is enforced, ensuring that the assembly code properly
  handles network connections.
