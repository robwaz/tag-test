summary: This challenge requires participants to implement a web server in assembly
  that handles multiple concurrent HTTP requests. The solution must adhere to a precise
  sequence of system calls, as verified by recorded strace output. Additionally, the
  binary runs in a sandboxed environment leveraging Linux namespaces, requiring careful
  process management and file operations.
